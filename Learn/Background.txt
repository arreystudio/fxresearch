2.1 Background and Rationale
The steel industry serves as the backbone of key sectors such as infrastructure, construction, manufacturing, and automotive, playing a critical role in global economic development. In developing countries like Indonesia, the steel industry is not only a fundamental pillar of national development but also a strategic sector targeted for industrial growth and downstream metal processing under national policy initiatives such as Making Indonesia 4.0 and the Down-streaming Minerals Policy (Institute for Essential Services Reform [IESR], 2025). As a result, the domestic demand for steel is projected to increase significantly in the coming decade, driven by large-scale infrastructure projects and rising urbanization, Indonesian Iron & Steel Industry Association (IISIA) noted that Indonesian steel production has shown a consistent upward trend. (Kredit Rating Indonesia, 2024).
Despite this growing domestic demand, the iron production in Indonesia is lower than its demand. Therefore, Indonesia has to import to fulfilling this high demand. It is because the lack of technology in Indonesia to produce (Sudipta & Wiryono, 2012). Indonesia’s steel sector remains heavily reliant on imported raw materials, capital equipment, and advanced technology most of which are priced and transacted in foreign currencies, predominantly the U.S. dollar (USD) (Kredit Rating Indonesia, 2024). In contrast, following the steel consumption growth trend during 2020 to 2023 periods, the majority of revenue generated by Indonesian steel producers comes from local sales and is denominated in the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). This creates a structural foreign exchange (forex) mismatch between cost outflows and revenue inflows, posing significant financial risks, especially during periods of sharp IDR/USD fluctuations. The uncertainty introduced by exchange rate volatility can adversely impact profitability, especially for companies with significant exposure to international transactions (Bambang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2016; Sufandi & Rahayu, 2019; Zayed et al., 2021).
This forex risk is particularly pronounced for PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk (“Krakatau Steel”), one of Indonesia’s largest state-owned integrated steel manufacturers. Headquartered in Cilegon, Banten, and listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX: KRAS), the company holds a central role in the nation’s industrial ecosystem. PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk (KRAS) accounted for approximately 23% of Indonesian steel production in average during 2019 to 2022 periods. KRAS’ steel production volume has generally increased during 2019 to 2021 periods which is in line with Indonesian steel production volume trend (Kredit Rating Indonesia, 2024). As a commodity-intensive and import-dependent enterprise, Krakatau Steel sources key raw materials including iron ore, coking coal, scrap metal, and specialized steel equipment primarily from international suppliers (PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk, 2023). These imports are invoiced in USD or other hard currencies, exposing the firm directly to exchange rate volatility. For instance, in 2023, the company reported that over 80% of its total procurement costs were related to imported inputs, most of which were settled in U.S. dollars, while approximately 70% of its revenue was generated domestically in IDR (PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk, 2023).
The Indonesian rupiah has experienced significant volatility over the past decade, influenced by a confluence of global and domestic factors, including changes in U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy, fluctuations in global commodity prices, capital outflow pressures, and domestic macroeconomic imbalances. According to Bank Indonesia (2025), the IDR/USD exchange rate depreciated sharply from approximately IDR 9,700/USD in early 2013 to exceed IDR 14,500/USD by 2015, briefly surpassed IDR 15,000/USD during the 2020 pandemic crisis, stabilized around IDR 14,000–14,800/USD between 2021 and third quarter of 2022, and then depreciated again around IDR 14,800-16,700/USD from last quarter of 2022 until second quarter of 2025. The exchange rate fluctuation significantly influences Indonesia’s economic growth by affecting trade competitiveness and investment flows (Supriyadi, Yanfitri, Arimurti, & Atharinanda, 2025). As an example, The depreciation of the Rupiah until IDR 16,412/USD in June 2025 has raised serious concerns for Indonesia’s manufacturing sector, particularly regarding import costs and operational stability (APINDO, 2025).
Krakatau Steel has been particularly vulnerable to these currency movements. The company reported net losses in multiple years, including USD 315 million in 2015 and USD 495 million in 2019, which were partly attributed to increased financial pressures from forex volatility and rising input costs (PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk, 2015 and 2019). To mitigate these risks, firms may employ financial hedging instruments such as forward contracts, options, or swaps or adopt operational strategies like natural hedging, pricing adjustments, or debt denomination management (Li, Rao, & Stoltz, 2025). However, the adoption of formal hedging mechanisms remains low among Indonesian firms, particularly in the state-owned and industrial sectors, due to limited access, financial constraints, and insufficient risk management expertise (Nasriani, 2024).
While various financial instruments and natural hedging strategies are available to manage forex risk, the effectiveness and adoption of these tools vary across firms (Zai & Mansur, 2024). Particularly in Indonesia, there is limited empirical research on how steel companies implement forex risk management and whether such strategies significantly influence its financial performance indicators such as return on assets (ROA), net income, or cash flow stability. This study aims to fill this gap through an in-depth case study of company like PT. Krakatau Steel (Persero), investigating the relationship between forex exposure, hedging practices, and firm performance.

2.2 Motivation of the Research
Although there are a lot of research focusing on foreign exchange volatility, but there are still several gaps in the literature that need to be further explored. Most studies focused on how to managing that foreign exchange volatility by using hedging strategies and tendencies to perform hedging, some report inconsistent results, suggesting that hedging effectiveness can vary depending on various factors (Zai & Mansur, 2024). Companies need to consider factor such as policy maker and resource availability, there is an importance to integrating financial and operational hedging strategies to maximize the hedging effectiveness. Further research is needed to examine dynamic nature of FX risk exposure and long-term impact of hedging practices on firm performances (Nasriani, 2024). 
This study is motivated by three main reasons. First, accounted for approximately 23% of Indonesian steel production in average, PT Krakatau Steel’s financial performance has implications for Indonesia’s broader industrial and economic stability, given its position as a strategic state-owned enterprise. Second, prior studies on Indonesian firms’ FX risk management tend to be descriptive, with limited use of long-term quantitative approaches. There is a need to test empirically the effect of FX volatility and hedging existence on financial performance using regression analysis. Third, by analysing the relationship between FX volatility hedging existence on firm performance, this research can provide guidance for corporate financial strategy and policymaking in managing exchange rate risks in strategic sectors.
Therefore, this research seeks to fill these gaps by conducting an in-depth, single-firm case study of PT Krakatau Steel with long-term period (2013–2025), analysing the relationship between IDR/USD exchange rate volatility and hedging existence to key financial performance metrics indicators: ROA, net income, and cash flow volatility, while controlling for leverage (DER), firm size (total assets), and liquidity (current ratio). By using quarterly time-series data, the study will identify patterns and correlations over a decade marked by significant macroeconomic volatility.

2.3 Research Objectives
Academically, the study contributes to the literature on corporate risk management in emerging markets by providing a detailed, firm-level analysis that complements broader panel studies with long-term observation period. It also demonstrates how research can proceed in the absence of hedging disclosures by focusing on direct exposure effects.
Practically, the results will inform risk management strategies for similar industrial firms in Indonesia, offering benchmark insights into how forex volatility and hedging existence translates into financial performance outcomes. It may also assist policymakers and regulators in formulating guidelines for sovereign firms operating in volatile macroeconomic environments.
2.4	 Research Questions
To address the core issues of this study, several research questions has been formulated. (1) How does foreign exchange rate volatility affect the financial performance of PT. Krakatau Steel, as measured by ROA, Net Income, and Cash-flow volatility? (2) Does the existence of hedging activities affect the PT. Krakatau Steel financial performance, as measured by ROA, Net Income, and Cash-flow volatility? (3) To what extent do firm-specific characteristics such as leverage (measured by DER), firm size (measured by Total Assets), and liquidity (measured by Current Ratio) influence the relationship between foreign exchange volatility, hedging, and firm performance?
2.5	Research Hypothesis
Based on these questions, the study proposes several hypotheses to be tested using firm-level financial data and macroeconomic indicators. The first hypothesis (H1) Exchange rate volatility has a negative and significant impact on PT Krakatau Steel’s financial performance (ROA). The second hypothesis (H2) Exchange rate volatility has a negative and significant impact on PT Krakatau Steel’s net income. The third hypothesis (H3) Foreign exchange rate volatility has a positive effect on Cash Flow Volatility. The fourth hypothesis (H4) The existence of hedging activities has a positive effect on ROA.  The fifth hypothesis (H5) The existence of hedging activities has a positive effect on net income. The sixth hypothesis (H6) The existence of hedging activities has a negative effect on Cash Flow Volatility. The seventh hypothesis (H7) Firm-specific factors (leverage, firm size, liquidity) significantly affect PT Krakatau Steel’s financial performance. These hypotheses will be evaluated through quantitative analysis over multiple time periods, particularly during phases of significant IDR depreciation, to determine the effectiveness and financial relevance of hedging strategies employed by the company.
