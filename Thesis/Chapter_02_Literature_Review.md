# Chapter 2: Literature Review

### Foreign Exchange Exposure and Volatility
FX exposure includes transaction, translation, and economic exposure. Economic exposure reflects competitive position changes as exchange rates move. For import-reliant firms like KRAS, IDR/USD volatility affects input costs, pricing, margins, and investment capacity.

### Hedging and Risk Management
Hedging can be financial (forwards, swaps, options) or operational (currency matching, natural hedges, revenue diversification). Firms hedge to reduce cash flow variability, mitigate distress costs, align risk with governance standards, and maintain access to financing.

### Firm Performance Indicators
- Return on Assets (ROA): profitability relative to assets.
- Net Income: bottom-line performance.
- Cash Flow Volatility (CFV): stability of operating cash flows (e.g., 12-quarter moving volatility).

### Firm Characteristics as Moderators
- Leverage (DER): amplifies exposure to adverse FX movements via debt service.
- Size (Total Assets): facilitates access to instruments and counterparties.
- Liquidity (Current Ratio): buffers working capital shocks.

### Empirical Evidence
Global and regional studies often find negative performance effects from FX volatility and benefits from hedging. Evidence for moderators is mixed and context-dependent.

### Research Gap
There is limited empirical synthesis linking FX volatility, hedging behavior, and firm-specific moderators within Indonesia’s industrial SOEs. This study addresses that gap for KRAS over 2013–2025.
