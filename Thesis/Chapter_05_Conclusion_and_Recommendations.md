# Chapter 5: Conclusion and Recommendations

### Summary of Key Findings
- FX volatility materially increases cash flow volatility, particularly post-2020.
- Hedging is effective in reducing cash flow instability; moderation of performance (ROA, Net Income) is modest.
- Leverage, size, and liquidity shape sensitivity to FX shocks (effects stronger with higher leverage and lower liquidity).

### Conclusions
- FX volatility impacts KRAS primarily through cash flow instability rather than steady-state profitability.
- Formal hedging programs can reduce volatility exposure; broader performance outcomes depend on operational efficiency and market conditions.

### Implications
- Corporate: implement structured hedging mandates (risk limits, tenor ladders, rolling hedges), integrate FX risk into treasury and liquidity planning.
- Policy: expand access to hedging instruments for SOEs, standardize FX risk governance, and consider incentives for prudent hedging.

### Limitations
- Single-firm scope; generalizability is limited.
- Measurement constraints and potential omitted variables.
- Regime inference relies on available diagnostics and data granularity.

### Future Research
- Extend to multi-firm/multi-sector panels.
- Test additional moderators (governance, export ratio, covenant structure).
- Explore ARDL and rolling-window methods for time-varying dynamics.
