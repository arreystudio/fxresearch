# Chapter 1: Introduction

### Background of the Study
Indonesia’s steel industry is a strategic pillar for national development, enabling infrastructure expansion, industrial manufacturing, and downstream value chains. PT Krakatau Steel (KRAS), the largest integrated steel producer, faces structural FX exposure because key inputs and liabilities are USD-denominated while most revenues are in IDR. Over 2013–2025, IDR/USD exhibited pronounced volatility, amplifying uncertainty in input costs, pricing, and cash management. Despite this, formal hedging adoption across state-owned and industrial sectors remains limited due to capability, governance, and cost-benefit constraints.

### Problem Statement
- How does FX volatility affect KRAS’s performance (ROA, Net Income) and cash-flow stability?
- Does hedging moderate these effects?
- How do firm characteristics (leverage, size, liquidity) influence these relationships?

### Research Objectives
- Examine the impact of FX volatility on firm performance and cash-flow volatility.
- Evaluate the role of hedging in mitigating FX risk.
- Analyze how leverage (DER), size (Total Assets), and liquidity (Current Ratio) shape these effects.

### Research Questions
- What is the relationship between FX volatility and firm performance at KRAS?
- Does hedging reduce cash flow volatility and performance fluctuations?
- How do leverage, firm size, and liquidity moderate these relationships?

### Significance of the Study
- Academic: contributes to understanding FX exposure in emerging markets.
- Practical: informs risk management and financial policy for KRAS and other SOEs.
- Policy: supports development of hedging frameworks for Indonesian state enterprises.

### Scope and Limitations
- Time frame: 2013–2025.
- Focus: PT Krakatau Steel (KRAS).
- Variables: FX volatility, hedging, ROA, Net Income, Cash Flow Volatility, firm characteristics.
